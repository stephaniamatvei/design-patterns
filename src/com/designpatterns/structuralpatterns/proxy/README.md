### Intent

**Proxy** is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

### Problem

You need to support resource-hungry objects, and you do not want to instantiate such objects unless and until they are actually requested by the client.

*Example*: You have a massive object that consumes a vast amount of system resources. You need it from time to time, but not always.

### Solution

The Proxy pattern suggests that you create a new proxy class with the same interface as an original service object. Then you update your app so that it passes the proxy object to all of the original objectâ€™s clients. Upon receiving a request from a client, the proxy creates a real service object and delegates all the work to it.

### When to use the Proxy pattern?

- When creating a wrapper to cover main's object complexity;
- When creating a security layer for preventing unauthorized access.
