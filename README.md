## What's a Design Pattern?

**Design patterns** are typical solutions to common problems
in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint
that you can customize to solve a particular
design problem in your code.

Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.

An analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a pattern is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.

## What are the uses of Design Patterns?

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improves code readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns.

In addition, patterns allow developers to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions. Common design patterns can be improved over time, making them more robust than ad-hoc designs.

## How are they classified?

- **Creational patterns.** These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- **Structural patterns.** These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- **Behavioral patterns.** These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
